## Scalar types
- scalary types =  a single value.
- rust has 4 primary: integers, floats, booleans, characters.
- ints can be signed (negative possible) or unsigned

## Compound types
- tuples group a number of values with a variety of types into a single compound type
- tuples have a fixed length -> cannot grow/shrink after declared
- can destructure the tuple with smooth brackets
